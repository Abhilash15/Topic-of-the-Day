## VISION ##

* Our team team is building an web application named  Topic-of-the-day .This app can give the updates regrding the specific topics of university (for example: dining, sports, library etc..) to the students. This app can be run in bth the android and iOS.  

* This contains an open login page with which the user can enter the  username and the password as the credentials  and can login into the app. 

## Working of the app ##
* After logging in to the app the users will be able to see the topics of the day and thereafter one click away they will find the updates about that particular topic daily. 
 
 * Everday the updates get changed , so with the help of this app the students can know the daily changes in  the app.

 * It even has a speciality of poping up an daily reminder of the most viewed topic by the students so that they would not miss any updated regarding the topic they are looking for.
